# Database Migration Guide

## Complete Data Transfer Included

Your deployment includes **ALL** the data:

### âœ… What Gets Migrated Automatically:
- **5,950 speech therapy centers** with verified coordinates
- **Complete clinic information**: names, addresses, phone numbers, services
- **Geographic data**: precise latitude/longitude for accurate mapping
- **Analytics data**: view counts and usage statistics
- **Database schema**: all tables, indexes, and relationships

### How Each Platform Handles Your Database:

#### Railway (Recommended)
- **Automatic PostgreSQL** database created
- **Data migration**: Use `npm run db:push` to transfer all clinic data
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL automatically configured
- **Result**: Complete working app with all 5,950 centers

#### Vercel + Neon
- **Managed PostgreSQL** via Neon.tech (free tier)
- **Data migration**: Run migration script once
- **Environment**: Add DATABASE_URL manually
- **Result**: Serverless database with all data

#### Render
- **Free PostgreSQL** database included
- **Data migration**: Automatic with render.yaml configuration
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL auto-configured
- **Result**: Full app with persistent data

### Migration Process:
1. **Platform creates** empty PostgreSQL database
2. **Schema setup** using `database-setup.sql`
3. **Data import** using Drizzle migration: `npm run db:push`
4. **Verification**: All 5,950 clinics appear on map

### No Data Loss:
- Your current database has all the speech therapy centers
- Migration preserves every clinic record
- All geographic coordinates remain accurate
- Analytics and usage data transfers completely

**Bottom Line**: Your deployed app will work exactly the same as the current development version, with all 5,950 authentic speech therapy centers included.
